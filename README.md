(7) The answer to the question is:

1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

Ans: 
    i. var is the oldest keyword: We are  Avoid using var in modern JavaScript (ES6+). Its function-scoping and hoisting behavior can lead to unexpected bugs that let and const were designed to solve.
     
     ii. let when our need reassignment: We are use it for loop counters or variables that need to change value.

     iii. By default, const: We use this for every variable declaration. If we later find out that we need to reassign it, we change it to let.


2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter
3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
